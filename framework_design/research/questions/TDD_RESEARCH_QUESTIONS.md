# TDD Research Questions for AI-Assisted Development

## Category A: TDD Fundamentals for AI Assistants

**Q1:** What are the most critical test-driven development principles that AI coding assistants must follow to produce high-quality, bug-free code? Focus on practical, actionable patterns that reduce debugging cycles and improve code reliability when AI writes tests first.

**Q2:** What are the top 5 most common mistakes AI assistants make when attempting test-driven development? For each mistake, provide the root cause, negative impact, and specific solution to prevent it.

**Q3:** How should test cases be structured and organized to maximize AI code quality and minimize debugging time? Provide specific test naming conventions, test data patterns, and organization strategies.

## Category B: SDLC Integration with TDD

**Q4:** How should test-driven development be integrated into the planning and requirements phase? Specifically, how should PRDs and functional requirement documents be structured so that AI assistants can derive comprehensive test cases from them?

**Q5:** What architectural patterns and design principles make code more testable when AI assistants are writing it? Focus on patterns that help AI understand module boundaries, dependencies, and interfaces clearly.

**Q6:** What is the optimal sequence for AI-assisted development: requirements → tests → code, or requirements → architecture → tests → code? Provide a detailed workflow with specific steps and quality gates.

## Category C: Technology-Specific TDD

**Q7:** What are the industry best practices for test-driven development in React/TypeScript frontend development? Focus on component testing, state management testing, hook testing, and integration testing patterns.

**Q8:** What are the industry best practices for test-driven development in Node.js/TypeScript backend API development? Focus on API endpoint testing, service layer testing, database interaction testing, and error handling patterns.

**Q9:** How should integration tests be structured in a full-stack TypeScript application (React frontend + Node.js backend)? Provide a complete testing strategy including API contract testing and end-to-end workflow testing.

## Category D: AI-Specific Pain Points & Solutions

**Q10:** What prompt patterns, context requirements, and guidance structures help AI coding assistants write comprehensive, high-quality test cases? Provide specific prompt templates and context organization strategies.

**Q11:** How should requirements documents (PRDs, functional specs) be structured so that AI assistants can automatically derive comprehensive test cases including positive cases, negative cases, and edge cases?

**Q12:** What validation strategies and quality checkpoints can catch issues in AI-written tests and code early, before the debugging cycle begins? Provide specific techniques, tools, and patterns.

## Category E: End-to-End Workflow

**Q13:** What is the complete, step-by-step test-driven development workflow from PRD to deployed code for AI-assisted development? Include specific phases: requirements analysis, test case derivation, test writing, code implementation, validation, and quality gates.

**Q14:** How should test data be managed throughout the software development lifecycle in AI-assisted TDD? Provide strategies for test data generation, organization, reusability, and maintenance.

**Q15:** What are the critical checkpoints and validation steps in AI-assisted test-driven development that prevent wasted time in debugging cycles? Provide a checklist or workflow with specific gates.
